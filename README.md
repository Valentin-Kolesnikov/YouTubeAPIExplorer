# (Console Beta vesion)  

YouTube Explorer is an unofficial tool for searching, filtering, and displaying comments from YouTube videos by keywords using the YouTube Data API v3.  

## Important clarification!!!  

The .exe file is in releases. This `.exe` file does not have viruses. It was created for convenience. I made this file thanks to `python -m PyInstaller --strip --icon="../Icon/IconYE.ico" YouTubeExplorer.py`. If you do not trust the `.exe` file, I recommend you to use the `.py` file in `Sources`.
